A simple way to share files on your phone with any phone, computer or tablet!

Just choose a file either from your gallery, a file manager or anywhere else, click on "options", "share" and "Share via HTTP"

I moved it from Google Code because it will shut down.


At the time I compiled it with Eclipse and http://androidannotations.org/

AndroidAnotation is nice but making it work at the time was a pain.
I hope it will be easier now.

I just found out there is a bug on getting the IPv6 Address, which I plan to fix as soon as possible.
